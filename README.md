# myfashionapp

Ubiqum project to create an SPA (single page application) using JavaScript. The topic and content was free of choice as long as the API was public available.

I found this API with data regarding coming fashion events in several major fashion cities online and created this fashion event web app using Vue CLI. The total design was on our own. Specific requirements for this project was to implement firebase and create a page for group chatting. Furthermore it was required to add user login and google login features.

The final design was deployed on Netlify under: https://fash.netlify.com/
